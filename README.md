Front-End Development Track - One Million Arab Coders-Milstone1-Animal Trading Cards Checkmark test

<h1>Implement a web page using HTML & CSS</h1>
<h3>Task</h3>
Use what you learned about HTML and CSS to convert an initial design into a functional web page!

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

HTML is used to structure your site
CSS is used for styling

<h1>Instructions</h1>

The Lab starts with the following files:

card.html
clownfish.jpg
design-prototype.jpg
styles.css
Your job is to try and recreate what you see in the design-prototype.jpg. You‚Äôll need to modify card.html to include attributes and use CSS selectors to style specific elements.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è
Please do not remove or alter any existing id attributes in card.html!

The card.html file comes with some initial HTML. A few HTML elements already have id attributes. The validation code requires these exact ids on these exact elements, so do not remove them or the validation will fail.

üõ† Required Changes ‚öôÔ∏è
Make the following changes to card.html

Change the heading to the name of your favorite animal
Replace the placeholder image with your favorite animal's image.

Also, change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, alt="name-of-your-animal" should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.

Note: You will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Later, we‚Äôll talk about how you can fix this problem using responsive images.

Edit the interesting fact paragraph

Edit the key characteristics
Edit the informational paragraph
üíÉ Style the Page üï∫
The CSS must apply these styles to match the design prototype:

link your stylesheet styles.css to the HTML or else your CSS will not be applied.
for the interesting facts card <div> with id="card", add a CSS class named animal-info
italicize the text for the animal's interesting fact
bold the labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
remove dots from the animal's list items
add a border around the animal's name, image, and information
add a border around the animal's information
add spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
‚úÖ Test Your Code ‚ùå
To pass the Lab, follow the instructions above to get card.html to render similarly to what's seen in design-prototype.jpg.

To test how close you are, click the "RUN CODE" button located in the bottom right of the Workspace. This will run the validator against your code. A popup window will appear and run through all of the tests. If something still needs to be done, it will appear in this popup window in red. Also, there's no limit on the number of times you can use the "RUN CODE" feature, so keep checking it until you pass!

Good luck!
